# lazarom37_PROG123
Repository for PROG 123 Server-Side Programming by Marcus Lazaro, Spring 2022 in Bellevue College. Below are written expectations for each phase provided by my instructor. This project covers ASP.NET MvC and SQL Database

### Phase 01
Create a view where the user can enter his/her account information on several text boxes
FName
LName
email
phone
address
UserName
 Password
This is the information the user will enter on the first page
Create a submit button and POST this information to a second page
On the second page, you will display the info the user typed on the first page
 You will use Model Binding / Strongly Typed. That means you must use a Model for this phase.

### Phase 02
Use the DALPerson class to send the user information to the Database
You will write code on the Home controller for this phase

### Phase 03
On top of the previous Phase, you will create a new page (EditPerson.cshtml) where the user can update his/her information. Display the user name, but don't let the user change it. No need to send it to the DB. Just display and let the user do the changes on the view.

### Phase 04
On top of the previous phase, you will now update the record on the database for the Person model.


### Phase 05
On top of the previous phase you will allow the user to delete a Person record from the database.

### Phase 06
Create a new controller and call it <yourLastName>Controller.cs
Create the proper folder for your controller and for your view
Create a layout with CSS, a banner for your store, and whatever images or theme you want.
Make it look good, since you may use this as an example of work you did when you try to get a job
Your layout does NOT have to be like the one I did. But have at least a banner and a navigation menu
Allow the user to login
Create a text box for username and password, check it against the DB and set the userID on the session

### Phase 07
Create a new controller and call it <yourLastName>Controller.cs
Create the proper folder for your controller and for your view

### Phase 08

On this message, show the user first name, address, the product name and the product price
